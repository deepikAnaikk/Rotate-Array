# Rotate-Array
This program rotates a given array to the left (counter-clockwise) by d positions. The rotation is done in-place with O(n) time and O(1) extra space using the Reversal Algorithm.

ðŸ§  How it works:
Reverse the first d elements.

Reverse the remaining n - d elements.

Reverse the entire array.

This simulates a left rotation efficiently without using extra memory.
